## Introduction

**CF Helper** is a web application designed to simplify the process of finding and understanding solutions to Codeforces problems. Built using **Next.js**, it leverages **Gemini API** for providing detailed explanations and **Cheerio** for web scraping solutions from the web.

This project is open for contributions during **Hacktoberfest 2024**! Whether you're new to open source or an experienced developer, we welcome all contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works

**CF Helper** works by allowing users to input specific criteria to find solutions for Codeforces problems. Here's how the process flows:

1. **Input Criteria**:
   - **Contest ID**: Specify the contest id (e.g., 1234), visible in the url of contest.
   - **Problem Number**: Select the question by letter (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).
   - **Preferred Language**: Supports a wide range of programming languages (C++, Python, Java, etc.).
   - **Preferred Rating**: Choose a rating level (Newbie, Pupil, Expert, etc.) whose solution you wish to view.

2. **Web Scraping**: Once you've entered the criteria, CF Helper uses **Cheerio** to scrape the web and fetch the exact solution that meets your preferences.

3. **Solution Explanation**: After fetching the solution, CF Helper integrates with the **Gemini API** to provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the solution, if requested by the user.

4. **Results**: You get the solution and the explanation delivered right to your screen, helping you understand the approach clearly and effectively.

## Features

- **Custom Problem Search**: Enter the contest ID, problem number, language, and rating level to get the exact solution you're looking for.
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically fetches Codeforces problem solutions using Cheerio.
- **Solution Explanation**: Provides detailed explanations via the Gemini API, helping you understand the logic behind the solution.
- **Multi-language Support**: Find solutions in your preferred programming language.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easily navigate through the solutions and explanations with an intuitive UI.
